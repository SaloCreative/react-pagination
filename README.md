# React Component Starter Kit

This is supposed to be a simple starter-kit for creating Open Source React
Components. It should include/support:

* a nice README
* some kind of LICENSE
* build + tests
* dist files (amd, common, global)
* .dotfiles
* example + demo (gh-pages, maybe?)

### Commands

```shell
$ cd your-component
$ yarn                          # Install development dependencies
$ npm run bundle                # Build scripts
$ npm run demo                  # Run webpack dev server
```
